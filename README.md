# Responsive-Portfolio
This was a fun project to work on. There was a lot of trial and error involed from figuring out what elements should be created using Bootstrap or CSS or combination of both. I feel like I came pretty far and have a better understanding in the limitations of both. I would like to continue to work on this project jsut so I do not become rusty while I am focusing on other coursework.
